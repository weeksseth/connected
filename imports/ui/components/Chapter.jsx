        <h1>Our Chapter</h1>
          RIT InterVarsity is a group that strives to bring Jesus to the students of RIT. We are a group of diverse students who are welcoming, inviting, driven, and eager to meet new people. We exist to see students and faculty transformed, campuses renewed, and world changers developed. We strive to address current, relative issues in the lives of RIT students, in particular the isolation that is so often felt on campus, and the incredible importance that we place on academic success and job placement as an assurance of future security.	Our goal, in response to God's love, grace, and truth, is to be and advance a witnessing community of students and faculty at RIT who follow Jesus as Savior and Lord. We desire to grow in love for God, God's Word, God's people of every ethnicity and culture, and God's purposes in the world.
