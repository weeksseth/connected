          <h3>Emma - President</h3>
          <img src="/images/emma.jpg" />
            Hello! My name is Emma Conrick and I am a third-year Packaging Science major at RIT. I have a minor in Business Administration and an immersion in Advertising and Public Relations. I grew up next to the Adirondacks in Glens Falls, NY, and was so excited when I came to RIT and found myself surrounded by such bright, friendly, and diverse people. A nerd at heart, my first year I wore my Jedi outfit all day to classes on Halloween and this past year I brought five lightsabers to my apartment.  When friends asked me why I brought five, I replied with, “Well, I couldn’t bring all of them.” During the summers, I work on staff at Camp Fowler, a Christian children’s camp. I lead week-long wilderness trips, enjoying my passion for hiking, kayaking, and canoeing. I became involved in InterVarsity Christian Fellowship during November of my first year, and have fallen in love with it ever since. It is my hope and my goal to see InterVarsity reach this campus as never before, and to bring God’s love, grace, and truth to each student in a personal way.  Feel free to contact me; I'd love to get to know you!

          <h3>Jeremy - Co-Vice President</h3>
          <img src="/images/jeremy.jpg" />
            Hi! I'm Jeremy Dagner and I am a third year Bio Medical Sciences major. I'm from a small hamlet across the Hudson from Albany called Averill Park. I am one of the co-vice presidents who leads the strategy team with Madison Mitchell. As vice president I am responsible for translating the vision of InterVarsity and transforming it into events that reach out to the campus and show God's love through caring community and the gospel. My first year at RIT I joined InterVarsity and became a member of Strategy Team. In my free time I enjoy playing tennis, basketball, soccer, and running. Other than sports I play piano, sing in choir, and love The Walking Dead. If you like to plan events, have fun ideas that you think would be fun to run as a chapter, or would just like to learn more about what we do on Strategy Team feel free to contact me!

          <img src="/images/maddie.jpg" />
            Hi there! I'm Madison (or Maddie), and I’m one of the co-vice presidents of InterVarsity this year serving alongside Jeremy Dagner. I’m a second-year Graphic Design major from Boyertown, PA. During my short time at RIT so far, I've already been privileged to see how powerfully God moves on this campus through InterVarsity’s loving community, and I'm so thankful that I’ve been given an opportunity to be a part of it. When I'm not working on homework or helping out with InterVarsity outreach, I love to read, write, play tennis, sing, care for my plants, and shamelessly binge-watch anime and sitcoms.

          <h3>Jess - Large Group Coordinator</h3>
          <img src="/images/jess.jpg" />
            Hey everyone! I'm Jess, and I'm very excited to be serving in InterVarsity this year as Large Group Coordinator! I'm a second year Visual Media Photography major, which is a fancy term meaning I take pictures and design things. If you ever wanna check out Rochester, I'm a lifelong native so we can totally go explore. I also love most all sports (playing and watching) and have a dream of learning to play the drums (although it hasn't materialized yet). God has met me in my faith during college more than I ever imagined already, and His grace continues to amaze me everyday. This journey of leading has opened my eyes to the many ways Jesus shows up in our hearts and our world. If you ever wanna grab an iced vanilla latte (the only coffee drink I can handle), let me know!

          <img src="/images/bobby.jpg" />
            I'm Bobby, the Small Group Coordinator for this year! I work to help the Small Group Leaders create the best environment possible to study God's word and grow as a community. I hope to see Small Groups grow, new leaders be raised up, and see those who are already leaders grow in their skill and capacity to spread God's message. If you are interested in joining a small group or becoming a small group leader, feel free to contact me. Or even if you just have some questions about it, I'd love to talk to you about it!

          <h3>Tammy Bixler - IVCF Staff Worker</h3>
          <img src="/images/tammy.png" />
          I'm Tammy Bixler, the InterVarsity Campus Staff Member at RIT. I was born and raised in Queens, NY, and graduated from Binghamton University in 2011 before joining InterVarsity staff, getting married, and then moving to Rochester to serve at RIT. Since InterVarsity exists on campus to establish and advance witnessing communities, I love that it's my job to walk alongside and encourage students to grow in their relationship with Jesus and their relationship with others. I provide leadership, coaching, and resources to empower students to develop their leadership potential and to serve RIT's campus and student body. My hope is that as students are transformed by the living, active God who loves them, they'll embody his character and live out His purposes by loving and stewarding what they've been given not just while they are part of the RIT community, but in whatever community they find themselves a part of after they graduate.
